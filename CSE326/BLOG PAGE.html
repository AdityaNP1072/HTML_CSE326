                    <b>What is Comic:</b>
                    <p style="width: 600px;">
                        Comics is a narrative medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or
                        other visual information. It typically takes the form of a sequence of panels of images.
                        Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue,
                        narration, sound effects, or other information. There is no consensus amongst theorists and
                        historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text,
                        some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass
                        reproduction or the use of recurring characters. Cartooning and other forms of illustration
                        are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form that uses photographic
                        images. Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.
                        Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and
                        tankōbon have become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the
                        21st century.

                </h1>
                Manga refers to an Asian style of trade paperback graphic novel that has recently reached new heights of
                popularity in the United States. Generally, Manga contains several genres that are relevant to very
                specific types of readers. Moreover, Shojo (also has the spelling Shoujo) is a genre typically read by
                young teenage girls, usually involving drama and romance. Whereas Shonen refers to manga primarily for
                boys and features humorous stories and high levels of action. Mainly, Manga is a translation of the
                original Japanese form, whose print is from right to left, in order to retain the authenticity of the
                original version. In particular, Manga titles are also frequently part of a series containing several
                volumes, and can be very addictive!

                Many comics and graphic novels offer thoughtful portrayals of real life. These can take the form of
                autobiography, relationship drama, or historical fiction, among other examples. Mainly, Slice-of-life
                comics are frequently popular with older teenagers and adults in search of a contemplative reading.
                Recently, the Slice-of-Life comics and graphic novels are having a moment as older teenagers tend to
                enjoy comics with a real flair to them.

                There are plenty of comics that live up to the name “comic!” From Mad Magazine to Simpsons Comics to
                editorial cartoons, comics are a great avenue for exaggeration, satire, and just plain ridiculousness.
                Cartoonists use different kinds of humor to communicate their message — the most common are irony,
                satire, and sarcasm. Especially in the arena of politics, cartoonists tend to use their craft to
                communicate vital information to the masses. Instead of ‘shiny wrapping and flowery bows’, political
                cartoonists successfully use humor to promote their message. It helps to make politics accessible to the
                masses.

                as graphic non-fiction, are a non-fiction element in the comics medium. Mainly, embracing a variety of

                Mainly, science fiction comics began as early as the 1930s in US newspapers. Moreover, they have since
                spread to many countries around the world. However, the two largest publishers of this comic genre today
                arguably are the United States and Japan.
                </br>
                Whereas fantasy comics have been around as long as the medium itself. The early years of fantasy comics
                began in the golden age and are heavy with notable works ranging from the All-American comics` (and
                later DC comics`) Greek myth-inspired superhero Wonder Woman to Dell`s Tarzan.

                Frights, chills, and thrills abound in comics with creepy illustrations and suspense-building stories.
                That is the crux of the horror comic book genre. Whereas Horror Comic strips, manga, and graphic novels
                are a comic classification that intends to impose fear and terror to frighten its readers.
                </br>
                Scary comics can either be supernatural or non-supernatural. It aims to provoke a response;
                psychological, emotional, or a physical reaction to fear. And to elicit this response, horror comic
                books use various techniques; unreal figures such as ghosts and aliens and real figures like serial
                killers and lunatics.
                </br>
                However, a horror comic's main ingredient is to have something unexpected in its story, something that
                can build the reader's fear of the unknown and his/her own anxieties.

                Moreover, the superhero genre has permeated pop culture and the internet. Mainly, Superhero comics
                feature the likes of Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and the X-Men, individuals often clad in capes and
                masks, who use their extraordinary abilities to protect humanity. Moreover, superheroes have captured
                the public imagination ever since the first appearance of Superman in Action Comics #1 in 1938. This
                first issue was heavy on action, adventure, and memorable iconic characters. One can say that Hero
                comics can be a form of modern mythology. While some characters and series have been in existence since
                the 1940s, new characters with different abilities, costumes, and universes are constantly on the verge
                of invention.

    <h1 style="font-size: 18mm;">Cultural effect of Comics</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 10mm">
        Through the decades of the last century and into our own, comic books have influenced culture as well as
        reflected
        it. Now an ingrained part of our cultural lexicon, the characters, conventions, art, and even language of comic
        books are everywhere including advertising, politics, and entertainment, in addition to being the subject of a
        growing field of scholarship. From their humble beginnings as reprints of comic strips, comic books have matured
        into works of art, literature and cultural significance in their own right.</br>
        “I think at a certain level, comics can't help but deal with social issues,” said Roy Bearden-White, assistant
        professor of English at South Plains College. “The very idea of the superhero is dealing with right and wrong.
        That's a lot of what we deal with on a daily basis. In another respect, I see comics as a reflection of who we
        are.”

    <img src="comic.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="font-size: 10mm;">
        Comic books have been one of the most popular segments of art and communication since it was created. During
        Human History, the comics were adapted to events every time. It is possible to notice that not only the creation
        of Captain America in the '40s to support the soldiers in World War II. But also the character offered solace
        when the attack on the World Trade Center Building took place in 2001.
        </br></br>
        Sexuality issues were also inserted in the comics to debate contemporary subjects. Mainly, to show that comics
        can change, tell stories of real people, and respect their differences. Whereas comic books are part of pop
        culture, most people might have an inaccurate thought process. Especially when it comes to comic books. People
        might think something about children and teenagers, but not about adults. They are not only wrong about this
        though, but they also don't have any knowledge about how comics affect people's lives. And how this kind of
        entertainment and mass communication has been profitable through the years.
        </br></br>
        Hot topics that are still relevant to this day include the views of women, LGBT persons, and ethnic minorities
        within society. Women have had a role in comics since their creation. Early depictions of women usually put them
        in the role of damsel in distress/ plot device or purely as a sex symbol.
        </br></br>
        In 1940, the first true, although mostly unheard of, female superhero is Fantomah (Markstein n.d, para 3).
        Fantomah, along with other early female comic protagonists Wonder Woman and Sheena, fell into the Jungle Goddess
        category. However, the role of the female in the background with the creation of the CCA. Furthermore, female
        characters didn't find a positive voice in comics until the 1980s and 1990s (Felton n.d., para 1). Whereas
        series such as Love & Rockets, Ghost World, and Tank Girl promoted strong portrayals of women, often with
        feminist leanings dealing with the exploration of sexuality in positive ways and the dismissal of expected roles
        in society.

        <u>What is comic to me</u>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 8mm;">
        Comics are for everyone, as you have read all about the above. But what they represent and mean to each
        individual varies. Personally, I have been reading comics for a while now. As an individual I am more into
        Manga(Japanise Comic),Manwha(Korean Comic). The genre I like include Romance, Fantasy.I also have my dislikes
        like psychological, emotional comics the reason is simple i just dont like being emotional and psychological
        stuf make my head hurt(i am just stupid :) ). Comics help me to explore an imaginative world with the eyes of
        the writer and the editor.
